## Sprint 1 Process Model
- Discuss project
  - Team meetings used to assign tasks, discuss progress on assigned tasks and disscus any problems people may be having with the project.
  - Further disscusion about implimenting and issues with individual tasks is had in a group discord server as these questions arise.
- Work on tasks
  - Work is done on assigned tasks in individual branches per task.
  - Issues are raised in issue tracker and on the discord server for disscussion.  
  - When work is completed a pull requested is posted.  
- Code review
  - Task is reviewed by teammates before pull request is accepted.
  - Code discussed during team meetings.

The overall process model for sprint 1 was informal, as many discussions were held outside of team meetings and instead discussions would be had in the discord server. 
These discussions would occur as problems arose during completion of tasks. Most work was done indepentantly and disscussions were held as people ran into problems.
Code reviews were not as enforced as they should have been and were held outside of meetings and only checked by one other teammate.

- Discuss product backlog
  - Done at start of sprint 
  - Disscus what tasks need to be finished during the sprint.
  - Create a list of all tasks to be completed to make sure none are forgotten.
  - All tasks will not be started on right away, assign so many each week.
  - Decide on what tasks should be completed first.

- Discuss sprint backlog
  - During a meeting we discuss the sprint backlog and what tasks need to be finished for the sprint.
  - These discussions are held at the beginning of the week to decide what tasks from the backlog can and will be completed by the end of the week.
  - Tasks are assigned to teammates to be completed throughout the week.
  - At the start of the next week, new tasks from the backlog will be assigned to be completed.
  - Only do a few tasks, usally one per person, each week to keep the team focused and avoid last minute rushes.
  - Tasks are posted on the kanban board.

- Progress updates throughout sprint
  - Each meeting in the week throughout the sprint we check on the progress of all tasks assigned for that week.
  - If a task is done, and code review will be held during that meeting.
  - If a task is still progressing, the task will be discussed so that it will be finished before the end of the week.
  - Also disscus issue's posted to the issue tracker and add them to the sprint backlog.
  - Make sure that all task will be completed by end of the week as to not overwhelm the team. If a task is not on pace to be completed The team will disscuss how to improve the progress, such as giving the task to another person
  - Kanban board and meeting notes are updated to reflect task progress.
 
- Code Reviews
  - When a task is done it will be reviewed during a meeting.
  - The code is persented by the person assigned to the rest of the team.
  - The code is tested to make sure it works not only on the assigned persons computer, but other teammates computers as well.
  - Code writing style and quality is shown and checked to make sure it matches the rest of the project.
  - Any bugs found during code review will be fixed then if possible.
  - If the code is working, style and quality is on par with other work and any bugs that are found are fixed, the code will be merged into master.
  - If code is rejected, It will need to be finished by end of the week for another code review, or by the start of the next week if possible to keep progress on weekly tasks consistant.
  - Results of the code review are stated in meetings notes.

 ### Deviations  
 - Code wasn't always reviewed by entire team. Due to having few meetings were everyone was in attendance, waiting for a day that everyone was there would take too long and hold up the project. It was decided to go ahead with code reviews as long as at least one person besides the person assigned to the task was present to review the work.
 - End of week deadlines weren't always enforeced, task completion was sometimes pushed to the start of the next week.
