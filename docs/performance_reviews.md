- **Muhammed:** Meeting attendance and contributin were pretty good. The communication was lacking a little before committing code or raising issues on the issue tracker. But the overall communication and contribution to the project was great. 
- **Tanaya:** Meeting attendance and project contribution was a bit slow initially, but improved throughout the project. Overall, the communication between the group mates could be increased.

# Sprint 2

## Ben
- **Muhammed:** Attended mostly all meetings, if he didn't attend he would follow up afterwards and respond to what he missed. Constant communication, never had to worry about not being able to contact him and kept the rest of the group up to date on his progress. Progress was good a never fell behind, always met deadlines. Great at assisting with other tasks. Kept issue tracker and kanban board up to date. Only criticism is that he is not always clear on his discussions or suggestions.  
- **Luckman:** Meeting attendance was ok, didn't show up to many in person meetings but would follow up on disccusions after. Communication was good and responded to any questions asked clearly. Progress was great, quickly finished work assigned. Helpful to others and would assist with tother task when neeeded. Updated issue tracker and kanban board as he made progress. Only suggestion would be to try to attend in person meetins more.  
- **Tanaya:** Huge improvment from sprint 1. Meeting attendance was solid for both in person and online meetings. Communication was good and responded to questions. Progress was still a bit slow but met deadlines. Willing to help with other tasks as need. Did not use the issue tracker or kanban board much, can improve in that area.

Overall, Tanaya's improved after sprint 1 and was seen taking part in meetings and taking her tasks seriously. 


## Luckman
- **Ben:** In-person/online meeting attendance was great, and communication regarding tasks and progress was excellent. Clearly communicated the workflow with others, and even contributed to help others with issues related to their tasks. Can't really think of any issues, the only suggestion could be to slighly improve HTML skils, everything else was perfect.
- **Muhammed:** Meeting attendance was pretty good, and did a great job maintaining the issue tracker and kanban board. Took a leading role and did a great job creating clean and updated documentation for the project. The only suggestion would be just a little more clarification before making any changes on the github. Overall contribution to the project was great.
- **Tanaya:** The overall contribution to the project was great, the assigned tasks were completed perfectly and any arising issues were communicated with the group. The only suggestion would be to slightly improve the workflow. Tasks were sometimes left till the end, but nonetheless completed correctly.


## Tanaya
- **Ben:** Ben was immensely helpful throughout the entire sprint, answering any questions that came up and maintaining a positive attitude. He regularly updated both the kanban board and the issue tracker, ensuring that everyone was on the same page. Ben attended all meetings, contributing valuable insights and feedback. Honestly, his support and contributions were flawless, and there's not much he needs to improve on. If anything, he could maybe focus on cleaning up his coding practices, but even that is just searching for something to suggest, he was amazing in explaining his code.
- **Muhammed:** Muhammed was pivotal in ensuring everything was completed on time and that the entire team felt supported throughout the process. He always attended meetings, keeping us aligned and focused on our goals. He made sure we stayed motivate throughout the entire process. Muhammed was diligent in updating the kanban board and the issue tracker punctually. There's really no complaint about his contributions; everything was perfect. If I had to suggest an area for improvement, it would be to increase in-person communication, although this is a minor point given his overall exceptional involvement and amazing communication skills in discord messages.
- **Luckman:** Luckman was exceptionally communicative, being available on Discord around the clock. He made sure to attend all meetings and kept the kanban board and issue tracker meticulously updated. His work was truly beautiful, and there's hardly anything that needs improvement. The only area where he could possibly make an adjustment is in attending more in-person meetings, but given his overall contribution, this is a minor suggestion, because he was always available online on discord throughout the meetings.
